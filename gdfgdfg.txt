\begin{abstract}
 Predicting protein movements and fluctuations has been an ongoing study for many years. The GroEL/GroES chaperonin protein system found in Escherichia coli (E. Coli)  goes through several different transformations, also known as states.  The states being a tense state 'T', relaxed state 'R'. and states with GroES attached to them (R prime, R double prime, etc.). Understanding whether these transitions are  within the natural motions of individual conformational states remains a question in the study of protein analysis. In this study, I performed Anisotropic Network Model (ANM) analysis on the 14 chains as part of the GroEL protein (Protein ID: 1GR5). To adjust my approach in performing ANM analysis, taking a coarse-grained approach by analyzing the alpha carbon atoms of each chain in the relaxed state protein, selecting from the best 10 modes that compare close to the tense state, doing so for all chains, and eventually selecting the chains by best mode to create a pseudoatom that shares the greatest resemblance. Particularly, the focus was on the transition between the T state and R state, performing ANM on the R state and selecting the modes that closely resembled those of the tense state.

\section{Introduction}

Proteins of all types tend to undergo several transformations. Understanding why and how certain proteins undergo these different changes is important, as the applications of these studies can impact health practices, biological impacts, and more. More specifically, using a theoretical study and comparing it to a transformation that happens in reality can give researchers a scope on just how practical an approach is. The GroEL-GroES protein system, often found in E. Coli, goes through different state changes for it's purpose is to correct misfolded proteins. Using the biological process ATP-Hydrolysis, proteins inside the double ringed body of GroEL to prevent aggregation, unfold, and refold a protein correctly before releasing the protein out of it's chamber. The Anisotropic Network Model  allows the study of a protein's collective movements, predicting how they potentially vibrate, flex, and change shape for functions. By turning a state of the GroeEL protein into an Anisotropic Network Model and seeing the different mode's fluctuations, we can see just how well the ANM can predict the transition. Taking individual ANMs for each chain of the GroEL protein and comparing the results to the actual transition, we can visualize and see a tangible difference between a predicted mode and actual state.

The GroEL-GroES system goes through three primary states: 
the R (relaxed) state, R' (intermediate) state, and T (tense) state. 
These transitions are important for the chaperonin's function, with the T to R 
transition representing the ATP-induced conformational change that opens the 
folding chamber and releases the substrate protein. This study particularly focuses on the T to R state transition which doesn't require ATP-Hydrolysis to be accounted for. The ANM requires a low energy minimum, and ATP-Hydrolysis violates that requirement, as the folding and unfolding of a protein inside the GroEL-GroES system requires a flux in energy. 

The topic of GroES/GroEL transitions has been studied before, with a particular study being an adjusted approach to ANM called aANM, which explores the functional transitions. The aANM approach is a computationally efficient and physically plausible tool for analyzing potential transition pathways for a given state by using large complexes/assemblies. Having multiple structures as inputs and an adaptive spring constant for the connectivity between atoms, the aANM results in an accurate and intuitive approach. 

By taking a different approach that focuses on verifiability of the ANM result rather than the strength of the prediction, less complex computation, the goal is to understand how close the ANM modes can replicate a state transition. Strictly using natural motions, finding an accurate overlap is not very intuitive, given the transition of GroEL's closed chamber form to an end having an opening. However, the goal is not to predict a structure, but compare intrinsic motion to natural motion. Using ANM with a coarse-grained C-alpha representation, we perform normal mode analysis on each of the 14 individual chains of the GroEL R-state (PDB: 4AAS) and calculate mode overlaps with the T state (PDB: 1GR5). The coarse-grained approach uses a uniform spring constant of 1 and a cutoff distance of 7 Angstroms, which is commonly used in research. Of the modes calculated, we take the lowest 10 modes and select the one that conforms closest to the tense state chain's structure. This gives insight on individual chains having asymmetric transition dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the best-predicting modes achieve overlaps of 18-21\%. Furthermore, we observe differences in Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values between chain groups, suggesting asymmetric  changes across the two GroEL rings. The RMSD calculates the average distance between atoms of our pseudoatom and the T state.



\section{Literature Review}

Proteins are not rigid structures, but are dynamic systems that take different formations based on several factors. In order to complete a study that revolves around comparing transformations, several mathematical tools are used to allow for computation. Atilgan, A.R. et al. proposed the idea of Anisotropic Network Models, with the goal of estimating collective motions which make up the base of my study. The initial idea of using Gaussian Network Models (GNM) has worked in protein analysis, but having three dimensional vectors helps give direction for protein fluctuations. My initial approach used GNM, but did not give directional motions. After having understood the mathematical formula for ANM, relevant research has been introduced, with that being the aANM approach by Eyal et al., which does not retain the spring constant parameters but bases it on local structural environment [cite Eyal 2006]. While aANM improves accuracy and is efficient, the approach of strictly using ANM to see how well natural motions can replicate a true state transformation in GroEL is not as complex. To go more in depth, I reviewed three different publications revolving around the idea of GroEL-GroES states, ANM, and aANM.

\subsection{Anisotropic Network Model}
Anisotropic Network Models come from the umbrella the Elastic Network Models. By selecting the Carbon atom (C$\alpha$) of each residue in a given protein, we map the network of C$\alpha$s to each other, with a cutoff distance in mind to reduce computation time. By creating this less complex network of atoms interconnected to each other, we assume each connection between the C$\alpha$s is a spring at it's equilibrium. A specific formula that utilizes matrices will be introduced in the methodology section, but for now, the output of ANM is several eigenvalues and eigenvectors, where each eigenvalue is related to the frequency and stiffness of a mode and each eigenvector is a 3$N$-dimensional vector where N is the number of atoms used. Ultimately, we get the network of atoms' fluctuations and possible coordinates, which are used in the current study.

\subsection{GroEL-GroES states}
As stated previously, the GroeEL-GroES chaperon protein assists in taking in improperly folded proteins and correctly folding them with ATP-Hydrolysis. The different states can be categorized into two different formal states with substates; 'T' for the tense/taut state, and 'R' for the relaxed [X. Fei,D. Yang,]. The T state, which has no GroES cap, waits for the ATP to be put into the chamber before going into the R state. From here, the R state goes through different primes, where R' has the GroES co-chaperon attached along with ATP. After going through ATP-Hydrolysis, we get ADP in the GroEL chamber along with the cap on, before returning to the T state. Certain details like the salt bridge breaks are relevant to the state transitions, but in the study are not accounted for.

\subsection{aANM}
The concept of the adaptive anisotropic network model  was introduced by Eyal et al. to address a limitation in standard ANM; the assumption of uniform spring constants between all residue pairs within the cutoff distance. This parameter adaptation is achieved by analyzing a training set of protein structures and deriving residue-pair-specific spring constants that better reproduce experimental B-factors and low-frequency vibrational modes. Thus , the aANm is an optimal approach for understanding how these big groups of molecules move and switch between different states.



\section{Methods}

The relaxed (R) state structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 4AAS and the tense (T) state from PDB ID 1GR5. GroEL consists of 14 chains in the form of two  rings: Ring 1 (chains A-G, the cis ring) and Ring 2 (chains H-N, the trans ring). Chain matching was performed using the ProDy library's sequence alignment function, which identifies structurally equivalent residues present in both conformations.

From there, rather than taking the ANM of the entire protein and comparing it to our target T state, we perform ANM analysis on each chain. The methodology for doing so was done in the same manner as Atilgan, A.R. et al. Using the idea of the uniform spring constant, the formula used is:

%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq1}
U_{ANM}= \frac{1}{2}\sum{\gamma(r_{ij}-r{ij}^0)^2}
\end{equation}
%

\subsection{Hessian Matrix and Contact Matrix}

The cutoff distance $r_c = 7$ Angstroms was chosen based on consistent use from previous researchers for elastic network models of protein complexes. The Hessian matrix $\mathbf{H}$, representing the second derivative of the potential energy, was constructed as a $3N \times 3N$ matrix (where $N$ is the number of C$\alpha$ atoms) with elements:

\begin{equation}
H_{ij} = 
\begin{cases}
-\gamma \Gamma_{ij} & \text{for } i \neq j \\
-\sum_{k \neq i} H_{ik} & \text{for } i = j
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $\Gamma_{ij}$ is the contact matrix:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{ij} = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } |\mathbf{r}_{ij}^0| < r_c \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Normal modes were obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eigenvalue}
\mathbf{H} \mathbf{u}_k = \lambda_k \mathbf{u}_k
\end{equation}



where $\mathbf{u}_k$ is the $k$-th eigenvector (mode shape) and $\lambda_k$ is the corresponding eigenvalue. The six lowest eigenvalues correspond to trivial rigid-body translations and rotations and were discarded. Their values fluctuate very closely to 0 and would not benefit our study. Modes 7-16 (the first 10 non-trivial modes) were used for the analysis.

To see how well each mode predicts the T to R conformational transition (in our case, we are calculating the ANM for the R state and comparing it with the T state), the overlap between each mode and the actual change was calculated. First, the T state structure for each chain was aligned to the corresponding R state chain using least-squares superposition to remove rigid-body rotations and translations. The conformational change vector $\Delta\mathbf{r}$ was computed as:

\begin{equation}
\Delta\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_T - \mathbf{r}_R
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{r}_T$ and $\mathbf{r}_R$ are the coordinates of the T and R states, respectively, after alignment. Both $\Delta\mathbf{r}$ and each mode vector $\mathbf{u}_k$ were normalized to unit length. The overlap coefficient $O_k$ for mode $k$ was calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:overlap}
O_k = \left| \frac{\mathbf{u}_k \cdot \Delta\mathbf{r}}{|\mathbf{u}_k||\Delta\mathbf{r}|} \right|
\end{equation}

An overlap value of 1 indicates perfect alignment between the mode and the conformational change, which is not a feasible value in this study. For each chain, the mode selected was the one with the highest overlap coefficient was designated as the "best mode" for predicting the T to R transition.

\subsection{Conformational Change Quantification}

To quantify the magnitude of conformational change for each chain during the T to R transition, each chain's RMSD values is computed using ProDy's calcRMSD function. For each chain, the T state structure was aligned to the corresponding R state structure. The RMSD was calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{RMSD}_{ T to R }^{(c)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\mathbf{r}_R^{(c,i)} - \mathbf{r}_T^{(c,i)}|^2}
\end{equation}

where $N = 515$ is the number of C$\alpha$ atoms per chain, and superscript $(c)$ denotes chain identity. These RMSD values represent the actual displacement magnitude observed in the experimental structures and provide scaling factors for pseudo-protein construction.

\subsection{Pseudoprotein creation}

As for creating our pseudoprotein, we first displace each chain along its best-predicting mode. The process involves three steps for each chain. First, the best mode (the eigenvector with highest overlap to the T state) is identified. From there, the selected mode vector is scaled to match the actual conformational change observed between the R and T states. Lastly, the scaled displacement is added to the original R state coordinates to generate predicted coordinates for that chain. This process is repeated for all 14 chains, using each chain's best mode and scaling factor. The resulting 14 sets of coordinates are then turned into a pseudoprotein structure. This helps later on in the analysis when we align the target protein and compare it to the pseudoprotein we just created. This pseudoprotein represents the ANM's prediction of the T state structure based only on the ANM modes of the R state, without any knowledge of the actual T state.

\subsection{Validation Metrics}



The pseudo-protein structure was compared to the actual T state structure (PDB: 1GR5) to assess prediction accuracy. Global alignment was performed by matching all 14 chains simultaneously based on chain identifiers. A total of 7210 C$\alpha$ atoms were matched across all chains. The pseudo-protein and actual T state structures were aligned using rigid-body least-squares superposition to minimize overall RMSD. The global RMSD was calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{RMSD} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} |\mathbf{r}_{pseudo}^{(i)} - \mathbf{r}_T^{(i)}|^2}
\end{equation}

where $N = 7210$ is the total number of matched C$\alpha$ atoms across all chains. Additionally, per-chain RMSD values were computed to analyze ring-specific conformational differences between Ring 1 (chains A-G) and Ring 2 (chains H-N). Summary statistics including the mean and standard deviation were calculated for both RMSD and overlap coefficients within each ring to quantify asymmetric behavior.

\section{Results}

From Fig. 1, we have the best calculated mode in bold for each chain. From our analysis, we see the highest related mode in the first ring is mode 2 for chain G. Ring 2 had chain N with the 10th mode being the largest overlap. From these details, we can see the first ring (A-G) experiences a majority conformation in the second mode, meaning the chain experiences a larger collective motion rather than individual. This makes sense as the first ring in the GroEL does not open up, where as the second chain does. Fig 3.

\section{Conclusions}
Overall, this study's goal was to apply a theoretical study to real transformation that happens in the biological space. The GroEL-GroES protein system is vital to life, as without it there wouldn't be correction in misfolded proteins. Rather than attempting to predict the final structure with ANM, my approach is an attempt to give a different viewpoint for analyzing protein fluctuations on individual chains rather than the collective C$\alpha$ atoms. Along with that, comparing theoretically derived low-energy collective motions with experimentally resolved conformational states gives us a tangible difference between a calculation found through theory and a real transition.

Our results show that, despite the simplicity of the ANM and its assumption of single energy minimum, certain low-frequency modes can display an overlap with the T state structures. The highest modes' overlaps fell into the range of 18–21\%, indicating that a portion of the T to R transition is minimally encoded in the dynamics of the R state. While these overlaps are not enough to explicitly say the transition is a natural harmonic motion, they are consistent by having a collective change in the base ring of the GroEL protein (Chains A-G) where the shape stays relatively the same in both T and R states.

The observed variation in RMSD values and mode overlaps across individual chains highlights asymmetry in GroEL’s transition dynamics, particularly between the two rings. This supports the idea that GroEL’s functional motions are not uniformly distributed across subunits and that individual chains may contribute differently to the overall conformational change. Such asymmetry aligns with experimental observations of staggered or cooperative behavior in chaperonin function.

Overall, this work demonstrates that even a minimal ANM framework can provide useful insight into the relationship between intrinsic protein motions and functional state transitions. While ANM alone is insufficient to fully capture energy-driven processes such as ATP hydrolysis, it remains a valuable tool for identifying which aspects of large-scale conformational change are rooted in a protein’s native mechanical architecture. These findings motivate further studies combining intrinsic motion analysis with more energetically explicit models to better bridge theoretical predictions and biological reality.
